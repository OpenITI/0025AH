90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digital Quran text, downloaded from the
    website https://tanzil.net/download/
    (the website offers many different download options -
    this is the "Simple (clean)" version
    downloaded as "Text (with aya numbers)", and without pause marks,
    sajda signs, rub-el-hizb signs and tatweel below superscript alefs).
    PV added mARkdown first-level headers for every sura, with the sura number.
    PV tagged every aya as a separate paragraph.
    Sura and Aya numbers are indicated on every line: `# <sura_no>|<aya_no>|
    <aya_text>`.
    The original file did not contain pagination;
    PV added a dummy page number under every sura
    (with the sura number as page number)
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): All three completed files turned into mARkdown without any change. It might be interesting to know that unlike the two other files, QuranAnalysis001-ara1 does not have bismillah at the beginning of Ayas, which much explain for difference in word numbers.
