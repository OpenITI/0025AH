90#VERS#COMMENT##: Digital Quran text, downloaded from the
    website https://qurananalysis.com/analysis/full-quran-text.php
    PV converted the text from html, and
    added mARkdown first-level headers for every sura,
    with the sura number and sura name.
    PV tagged every aya as a separate paragraph.
    The original file did not contain pagination;
    PV added a dummy page number under every sura
    (with the sura number as page number)
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): All three completed files turned into
    mARkdown without any change. It might be interesting to know
    that unlike the two other files, QuranAnalysis001-ara1
    does not have bismillah at the beginning of Ayas,
    which much explain for difference in word numbers.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
