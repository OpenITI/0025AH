90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: the name of the annotator (latin characters; please
    use consistently)
90#VERS#COMMENT##: appears to follow the edition, though pagination is a bit off; edition notes where each of the poems is cited in footnotes; the introduction does not note a manuscript on which it is based, so I have a strong impression that this is a modern "diwan" which did not circulate as such in the past; pdf includes contextual information for most poems - isnads + basic info about context for poem; digital edition preserves only the meter
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
